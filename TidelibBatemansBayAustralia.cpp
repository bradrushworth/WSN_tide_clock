/*  TidelibBatemansBayAustralia.cpp 
 This source file contains a tide calculation function for the site listed
 below. This file and the associated header file should be placed in the
 Ardiuno/libraries/ directory inside a single folder.

 Released under the GPL version 3 license.
 Compiled for Arduino v1.6.4 circa 2015

 The harmonic constituents used here were originally derived from 
 the Center for Operational Oceanic Products and Services (CO-OPS),
 National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
 Administration, U.S.A.
 The data were originally processed by David Flater for use with XTide,
 available at http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html
 The predictions from this program should not be used for navigation
 and no accuracy or warranty is given or implied for these tide predictions.

const int adjustGMT = -1;      // Time zone adjustment to get time in GMT.
//Make sure this is correct for the local standard time of the tide station.
// 8 = Pacific Standard Time (America/Los_Angeles)
/* Initialize harmonic constituent arrays. These each hold 37 values for
the tide site that was extracted using the R scripts:
tide_harmonics_parse.R and tide_harmonics_library_generator.R

The values are available from NOAA's http://tidesandcurrent.noaa.gov site.
Kappa here is referred to as 'Phase' on NOAA's site. The order of the
constituents is shown below in the names. Unfortunately this does not match
NOAA's order, so you will have to rearrange NOAA's values if you want to
put new site values in here by hand.
The Speed, Equilarg and Nodefactor arrays can all stay the same for any site.
